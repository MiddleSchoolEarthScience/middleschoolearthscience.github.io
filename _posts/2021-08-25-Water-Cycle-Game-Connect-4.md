Water Cycle Connect 4 includes a diagram of the water cycle, a detailed lesson plan with suggested pre-game activities and a preparation checklist, tokens for each player, a familiar looking gameboard, a visual example of gameplay and easy to follow game instructions.

Field tested with sixth-graders, this game challenges students to think of the water cycle in terms of water stores and water flows. It helps students to break misconceptions of the water cycle as a simple process involving only evaporation, condensation and precipitation; instead, students finish the game understanding the complex web of stores and flows in the hydrosphere.

NOTE: This game requires the player tokens to be cut out before playing. It's a significant amount of cutting and I recommend having your students help.
