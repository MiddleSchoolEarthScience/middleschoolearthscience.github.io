Stellar Evolution Connect 4 includes a diagram showing the "life stages" of stars, a detailed lesson plan with suggested pre-game activities and a preparation checklist, tokens for each player, a familiar looking gameboard, a visual example of gameplay and easy to follow game instructions.

Field tested with sixth-graders, this game challenges students to commit to memory the stages of "life" of high-mass and low-mass stars. It helps students to break misconceptions of stars as always existing and students finish the game understanding the complex "lives" of stars and their demises into dwarfs, black holes and planetary nebula.

NOTE: This game requires the player tokens to be cut out before playing. It's a significant amount of cutting and I recommend having your students help.
