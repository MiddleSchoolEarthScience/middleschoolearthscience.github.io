Rock Cycle Connect 4 Game includes a diagram of the rock cycle, a detailed lesson plan with suggested pre-game activities and a preparation checklist, tokens for each player, a familiar looking gameboard, a visual example of gameplay and easy to follow game instructions.

Field tested with sixth-graders, this game challenges students to think of the rock cycle in terms of states of matter and geologic processes. It helps students to break misconceptions of the rock cycle as a predetermined order rock material must follow; instead, students finish the game understanding the complex web of geologic processes

NOTE: This game requires the player tokens to be cut out before playing. It's a significant amount of cutting and I recommend having your students help.
